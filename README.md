# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a movie recommendation system designed to suggest relevant movies based on a user-selected title. The system leverages content-based filtering techniques to identify similarities between movies using their metadata.

## Project Overview

The recommender system is built using Python and follows a content-based filtering approach, where recommendations are generated by analyzing movie attributes rather than user behavior.

### Key Components

- **Data Preparation:**  
  Movie metadata such as titles, genres, keywords, and descriptions are collected and preprocessed to create a structured dataset suitable for analysis.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Textual features are transformed into numerical representations using vectorization techniques (e.g., CountVectorizer or TF-IDF). This converts categorical and textual data into vectors that machine learning algorithms can process.

- **Similarity Computation:**  
  The system calculates the similarity between movies by applying cosine similarity on the vectorized feature set. This metric quantifies the closeness of movie vectors in the feature space, enabling the identification of closely related films.

- **Recommendation Logic:**  
  Given a selected movie, the system ranks other movies based on their similarity scores and returns the top recommendations.

## Machine Learning Concepts Utilized

- **Content-Based Filtering:**  
  Unlike collaborative filtering, this method recommends items by comparing item features rather than user interactions.

- **Vectorization:**  
  Textual movie attributes are converted into high-dimensional numerical vectors using techniques such as CountVectorizer or TF-IDF, enabling mathematical similarity computations.

- **Cosine Similarity:**  
  A distance metric used to measure the angle between two vectors, effectively capturing the similarity in terms of feature overlap.

## Technologies and Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas (data manipulation)  
- Scikit-learn (vectorization and similarity computations)  
- Pickle (for loading preprocessed data)

## Project Structure

- `app.py` — Core logic for loading data, calculating similarities, and generating recommendations  
- `movies_dict.pkl` — Serialized dataset containing movie metadata  
- Additional scripts or files for data preprocessing (if applicable)
